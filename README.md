# Thunderdome
This is a game made by me and another developer in 2023. It is a first person shooter that takes place in a small futuristic arena where you have to survive against waves of robots with different abilities and behaviours. As you progress through the waves and build up your combo meter, the music gets more intense and you receive a higher score.

The game is developed in Unity using C# and all assets were 3d modeled and animated in blender. Particles and VFX were all created in engine and the enemy AI was implemented from scratch using behaviour trees and state machines in C#. 

The game was nominated for the LiU Game Awards.
